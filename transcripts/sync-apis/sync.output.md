Create some types and values with deep-dependencies and cycles to ensure we have non-trivial components.

``` unison
unique type A = SomeNat Nat | SomeB B

unique type B = SomeA A | SomeString Text

a = 'let
  !b + 1

b = 'let
  !a + 2

xs = [a, b]

ys = [!a, !b] :+ 3
```

``` ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      type A
      type B
      a  : 'Nat
      b  : 'Nat
      xs : ['{g} Nat]
      ys : [Nat]

```
Push and pull it back.

``` ucm
proj/main> push @transcripts/proj/main

  Uploaded 358 entities.

  I just created @transcripts/proj on http://localhost:5424

  View it here: @transcripts/proj/main on http://localhost:5424

proj/main> branch.create-empty pulled

  Done. I've created an empty branch proj/pulled.
  
  Tip: Use `merge /somebranch` to initialize this branch.

proj/pulled> pull @transcripts/proj/main

  ✅
  
  Successfully pulled into proj/pulled, which was empty.

proj/pulled> ls

  1. A        (type)
  2. A/       (2 terms)
  3. B        (type)
  4. B/       (2 terms)
  5. a        ('Nat)
  6. b        ('Nat)
  7. builtin/ (469 terms, 74 types)
  8. xs       (['{g} Nat])
  9. ys       ([Nat])

```
``` unison
newValue = 99
```

Do a fast-forward push.

``` ucm
proj/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    newValue : Nat

proj/main> push

  Uploaded 3 entities.

Do a non-fast-forward push.

``` ucm
proj/main> branch /diverge 

  Done. I've created the diverge branch based off of main.
  
  Tip: To merge your work back into the main branch, first
       `switch /main` then `merge /diverge`.

```
``` unison
diverge = 100
```

``` ucm
proj/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    diverge : Nat

proj/main> push @transcripts/proj/main

  Uploaded 3 entities.

  View it here: @transcripts/proj/main on http://localhost:5424

```
``` unison
diverge = 200
```

``` ucm
proj/diverge> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    diverge : Nat

proj/diverge> push @transcripts/proj/main

  @transcripts/proj/main on http://localhost:5424 has some
  history that I don't know about.

```
Pull to trigger local merge

``` ucm
proj/diverge> pull @transcripts/proj/main

  Merging...

  I couldn't automatically merge remote @transcripts/proj/main
  into proj/diverge. However, I've added the definitions that
  need attention to the top of scratch.u.
  
  When you're done, you can run
  
    merge.commit
  
  to merge your changes back into diverge and delete the
  temporary branch. Or, if you decide to cancel the merge
  instead, you can run
  
    delete.branch /merge-remote-main-into-diverge
  
  to delete the temporary branch and switch back to diverge.

```
``` unison:added-by-ucm scratch.u
-- proj/diverge
diverge : Nat
diverge = 200

-- @transcripts/proj/main
diverge : Nat
diverge = 100

```
