Sorry, you've encountered a weird situation that we are aware of and are currently working on a fix for.
I'll explain what happened and how you can work around it.

The following cyclic definition sets could not be completely ordered:
  * User "ping", User "pong"


This happens when multiple definitions in a mutually recursive cycle have a very similar structure.

You can work around this by restructuring them to be less similar, e.g. by adding a pure expression to distinguish them, like:
_ = "this is the foo definition"


This is a Unison bug and you can report it here:
